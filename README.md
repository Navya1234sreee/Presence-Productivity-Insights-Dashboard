# Presence-Productivity-Insights-Dashboard
Project Overview: Presence & Productivity Insights
This project involved developing a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard designed to monitor and analyze workforce engagement through three primary lenses: physical/digital presence, remote work adoption, and leave patterns.
1. Objective

   
The goal was to create a data-driven tool that provides leadership with a clear view of how the workforce is operating in a hybrid environment. It focuses on identifying attendance trends, quantifying the impact of Work From Home (WFH) policies, and monitoring health-related risks through Sick Leave (SL) tracking.



This dashboard, titled Presence & Productivity Insights, provides a comprehensive look at workforce engagement and leave patterns. Below are the key points and a draft LinkedIn post you can use to showcase this work.


Key Insights from the Dashboard


• Top-Line Metrics: The overall Presence % and WFH % (Work From Home) are both exactly 14.20%, indicating a strong correlation between remote work and general attendance in this dataset.


• Sick Leave Trends: The overall SL % (Sick Leave) is low at 1.21%, with a notable peak of 4.14% early in the month before trending downward.

• Peak Activity: Productivity/Presence metrics show a dramatic surge after Day 20, reaching a sustained 100% toward the end of the month.

• Top Performers: Individuals like Alexander Davenport, Gustavo Ritter, and Leslie Navarro maintain a 100% Presence and WFH rate.

• Daily Breakdown: Mondays show the highest engagement levels at 17.20%, while weekends (Saturday/Sunday) show 0% activity, confirming a standard Monday-Friday work week.



🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
• Data Visualization: Power BI was used to create the interactive dashboard and develop the custom layouts for the Presence, WFH, and SL metrics.

• Data Modeling: Utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate complex measures such as the overall 14.20% Presence % and the dynamic 1.21% SL %.

• Data Transformation: Power Query was leveraged to clean and shape the raw attendance logs into a structured format suitable for daily trend analysis.

• Time Series Analysis: Implemented Trend Lines and Area Charts to visualize the significant surge in productivity after Day 20.

• User Experience (UX): Designed a custom UI focusing on "scannability," using KPIs for high-level metrics and detailed tables for granular individual performance tracking.



💼 Business Impact
* Resource Optimization: Identifies office utilization rates (currently at 14.20%), helping leadership scale real estate and overhead costs.
* Productivity Mapping: Pinpoints high-output "crunch times"—like the 100% surge seen after Day 20—to better align project deadlines.
* Retention & Wellness: Early detection of rising sick leave allows HR to intervene before health trends impact long-term retention.
